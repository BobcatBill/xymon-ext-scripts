# Place this file in /usr/local/www/xymon/client/ext/
# Then, to activate simply append the following to
# the /usr/local/www/xymon/client/etc/clientlaunch.cfg file:
#
#[smart]
#        ENVFILE $XYMONCLIENTHOME/etc/xymonclient.cfg
#        CMD $XYMONCLIENTHOME/ext/smart.sh
#        LOGFILE $XYMONCLIENTLOGS/smart.log
#        INTERVAL 5m
#
# You may also need to add something like this to your sudoers file:
# 
# Cmnd_Alias SMARTCTL = /usr/local/sbin/smartctl
# xymon ALL=SMARTCTL, NOPASSWD: SMARTCTL
#
# Now restart the xymon client to start using it.

# Xymon doesn't have /usr/local in PATH
